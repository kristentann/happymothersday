<p> happy mothers day mom!! i find glimpses of you in the most unexpected places: in the embrace of my stuffed shark, 
    beneath the enchanting tree canopy, during joyful car rides, at our favorite dimsum restaurant, Chef Tony's, old people pushing carts, 
    and on leisurely walks around Richmond, among countless other moments. from the minute i wake up and long for your comforting embrace, 
    i realise how much i miss you. it feels like those six months you were here went by too quickly, 
    and i regret not making the most of our time together, especially during your 50th birthday, 
    because of how stressed i was at school. i am deeply sorry, mom. 
    everyday i regret those days that u were here and i was not (physically and emotionally with you).
    <br>
    <br>
    i promise to work and study hard while also taking care of myself, and i hope you will also take care of urself mom. i apologise for my recent moodiness and disrespectfulness. i struggle with controlling my temper and i am actively trying to work on it. these initial days of summer have been i have also been extremely sad in the first few days of summer because of a lot of reasons and i am trying to fix that too. 
<br>
<br>
thank you for always being my rock and serving as my inspiration to pursue my hopes and dreams. i promise to make it up to you in the future and be the one to take care of you not out of obligation, but out of genuine love and desire. i love you so much mom and i miss you every single day.
